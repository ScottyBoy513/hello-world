# hello-world
Hello. My name is William. I am here to learn all about web design and I am excited to start creating my first website. I know a little html already, so that is exciting, but I am still a little confused. Hopefully I will understand everthing eventually. We are editing and working today to see if we are able to fork a repository, create a pull request, and merge.
